## Features
* Login, signup, forgot password, reset password features.  
* Organizations management.  
* Shifts and breaks management.  
* Allow users to change their own name, email address, or password.  
* Allow users to modify or delete existing shifts.  
* A table of prior employees shifts (inactive users table).  
* Allow users to filter which shifts are visible based on employee or a date range or both.  
* When creating a shift, if the finish time of a shift is earlier than the start time, the shift is considered overnight.   
* The hourly rate is doubled for shifts worked on a Sunday.   
* People often take more than one break when they work. For this project, instead of a shift having a single break length, it could have multiple.  
* Users to belong to more than one organisation. 
* Datepicker and Timepicker components.  
* Filter and sorting.  
* React SPA. 
* Welcome email sent to new users
